BO Data Services Dataflow Generator

This python based program can generate BO Data Services dataflows using CSV as input. The current version only supports generating separat jobs, workflows and dataflows. 

Instructions:
- Create a CSV according to the sample.csv format. Provide type (job, workflow or dataflow) and name
- Run the program with parameters: 
  1. input csv file (with directory if in another directory)
  2. output xml file (with directory if in another directory)
- Load the output xml file into data services

Example:
python codeGenerator.py sample.csv output.xml

Tested against BODS version:
14.2.10.1748
In theory it should work with other versions of BODS

Upcoming changes:
- Adding dataflow to a workflow
